# SENSDASH v1.1

This is a Stata package that plots sensitivity dashboards for multiverses of replication estimates. The package comes with two commands: `sensdash` is the main command, and `sensdash_gendata` generates a dataset that is used in the help file of the command to show examples of how the command works. 

The package can be installed by executing in Stata:
```
net install sensdash, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guntherbensch/sensdash/master") replace
```

Once installed, please see `help sensdash` for the syntax and the whole range of options.
