# SENSDASH v1.1

⚠️ **The functions of this Stata package have been included in the Stata package `repframe`, which is also available here on GitHub. Please use that command for full functionality and up-to-dateness.**  

This is a Stata package that plots sensitivity dashboards for multiverses of replication estimates. The package comes with two commands: `sensdash` is the main command, and `sensdash_gendata` generates a dataset that is used in the help file of the command to show examples of how the command works. 

The package can be installed by executing in Stata:
```
net install sensdash, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guntherbensch/sensdash/main") replace
```

Once installed, please see `help sensdash` for the syntax and the whole range of options.
